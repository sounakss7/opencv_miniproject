Reading an Image: To read an image, we use the imread() function in OpenCV. It’s like opening a door to the image world—once you’ve read an image, you can explore it, edit it, or perform various operations on it. Here’s the basic syntax for reading an image:
Displaying an Image: Once you’ve read the image, you can display it using the imshow() function. This creates a GUI window showing the image.
The waitKey(0) function waits for a key press (in this case, any key) before closing the window. You can adjust the argument to specify a different delay (in milliseconds) if needed.
Writing an Image: Now, let’s say you want to save the processed image. You can use the imwrite() function:
